# react-calendar

This is just a simple react calendar app I made. It includes the ability to add events, a fully functioning calendar, update events, delete events. It also sorts them by time and has them assigned to the correct days (kind of important). It is not responsive, the code probably needs some cleaning up, I would also like to split the main css file up and clean the CSS up a bit but I just kind of threw it together as I created the components. I may return to this and update responsive and add functionality or not, not entirely sure.
